What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge in git is when you integrate changes in one branch into
another branch. This creates a new commit that combines the changes
in the two branches.                                     
A rebase in git is when you change the commit history of a repository
by selecting a new commit to use as the base commit for a series of
other commits that branch from the main branch. This makes
the commit history more linear.
