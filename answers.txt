What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge in git is when you integrate changes in one branch into
another branch. This creates a new commit that combines the changes
in the two branches.                                     
A rebase in git is when you change the commit history of a repository
by selecting a new commit to use as the base commit for a series of
other commits that branch from the main branch. This makes
the commit history more linear.

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is the central online repository that is seen by several 
collaborators on the same project, it allows you to do work on your local repository
as to not effect the master branch and then commit the changes you make when you are done.
